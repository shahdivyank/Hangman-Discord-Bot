# Hangman-Discord-Bot

The classic single player game of Hangman! Built right into Discord, using commands, you can play this game in any channel as long as the bot has appropriate permission to access those channels. Once the bot is invited using the link below, you can start a game with !playHangman. The bot will address you with the mystery letters and start allowing you to guess the different letters. To place a guess, use !guess guess_letter, ensure you only enter single characters. If you believe you know the entire word, you can guess using !guessWord guess_word. To end the game and forfeit, you can use !endgame. At the end of each round, the bot will tell you the mystery word, along with the various dictionary definitons.
